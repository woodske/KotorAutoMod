# KotorAutoMod

This application aims to make modding KotoR I a little bit easier. When able, it will try to automatically apply your selected mods to your KotoR installation. There are many mods that rely on TSLPatcher which for now will require some clicking on your part, but this application will run those TSLPatchers one at a time in a compatible order. This is intended to be used on a fresh KotoR installation.

The ordering and instructions for the mods were taken from this page: https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1463

## How to use

There are some configuration selections to the bottom left of the application. You will need to... 
* Select your swkotor installation folder 
* Select the folder with all of your *compressed* mods (the files needed can be found by clicking a mod in the available mods or missing mods sections)
* Checkbox for doing a widescreen setup (this is highly recommended)
* Some mods require your aspect ratio and screen resolution so select those if available

Mods that are supported by the application and found in your mods folder will be listed under 'Available Mods'. Check the ones you would like to apply, then hit 'Apply Mods'. There will be instructions for each mod in the instructions box. Most mods just simply need you to press install on TSLPatcher.
